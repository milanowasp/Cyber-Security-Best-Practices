# What is API?
An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules that specifies how two software programs should interact with each other. APIs enable software developers to build programs that can use the functionality of other programs. For example, if a developer wanted to use a specific feature of an operating system or a piece of software, they could use the API provided by that software to access that feature. APIs are a way for different software programs to communicate with each other and share data and functionality.

**Why we need to secure our APIs?**
APIs are used to allow different software programs to communicate with each other, and as such, they can often be accessed over the internet. If an API is not secured, it can potentially be accessed by anyone with an internet connection, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. Hackers could use an unsecured API to gain access to sensitive data or to disrupt the operation of the system that the API is a part of. In order to protect against these types of threats, it is important to secure APIs by implementing authentication and authorization measures, as well as other security measures such as encryption and input validation.

What is API Gateway?
An API gateway is a software layer that sits between an API and its clients. Its primary purpose is to route API requests to the appropriate backend service and return the service's response back to the client.

API gateways can provide additional functionality such as:
  •	Load balancing: Distributing incoming API requests across multiple backend services to improve performance and availability.
  •	Caching: Storing the responses from backend services in memory to reduce the number of requests made to the backend and improve performance.
  •	Throttling: Limiting the number of API requests that can be made in a given time period to protect against denial of service attacks.
  •	Authentication: Verifying the identity of API clients before allowing them to access the API.
  •	Authorization: Controlling which clients or users are allowed to access the API and which actions they are allowed to perform.
  •	Monitoring: Tracking the performance of the API and its backend services and generating reports or alerts when issues arise.

API gateways can also act as a single entry point for multiple APIs, making it easier for clients to access the API and for API developers to manage the API.


Here are top API security best practices for developers:
  1.	Use secure coding practices: Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS). This includes validating user input, sanitizing output, and using secure coding frameworks and libraries.
  2.	Implement authentication and authorization: Ensure that only authorized users can access the API by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or username and password.
  3.	Use transport security: Use transport security such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the communication between the API and the client.
  4.	Use rate limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or denial of service attacks.
  5.	Monitor and test: Monitor the API for security vulnerabilities and perform periodic security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning to ensure that the API is secure.
  6.	Keep the API and its dependencies up to date: Regularly update the API and any dependencies to ensure that they are secure and free of known vulnerabilities.
  7.	Use secure communication protocols: Use secure communication protocols such as HTTPS to secure the communication between the API and the client.
  8.	Use secure data storage: Store sensitive data in a secure manner, such as using encryption or hashing.
  9.	Implement access controls: Use access controls to limit access to sensitive data and functionality to authorized users only.
  10.	Use strong passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts associated with the API.
  11.	Use multifactor authentication: Implement multifactor authentication to add an extra layer of security to user accounts.
  12.	Use a firewall: Use a firewall to protect the API from external threats.
  13.	Use a content delivery network (CDN): Use a CDN to distribute the API across multiple servers and locations, improving performance and security.
  14.	Use a web application firewall (WAF): Use a WAF to protect the API from common web-based threats such as injection attacks and cross-site scripting (XSS).
  15.	Use secure data transmission: Use secure data transmission methods such as SSL or TLS to protect data in transit.
  16.	Use secure data deletion: Ensure that sensitive data is securely deleted when no longer needed.
  17.	Use encryption: Use encryption to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
  18.	Use secure coding frameworks: Use secure coding frameworks and libraries to help prevent common vulnerabilities.
  19.	Use secure development practices: Follow secure development practices such as code review and testing to ensure that the API is secure.
  20.	Use secure hosting: Use a secure hosting environment to host the API, such as a private cloud or virtual private server (VPS).
